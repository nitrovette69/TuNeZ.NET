# This workflow will build and push a web application to an Azure Static Web App when you change your code.
#            - name: Upload a Build Artifact
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4.3.1
  with:
    # Artifact name
    name: # optional, default is artifact
    # A file, directory or wildcard pattern that describes what to upload
    path: 
    # The desired behavior if no files are found using the provided path.
Available Options:
  warn: Output a warning but do not fail the action
  error: Fail the action with an error message
  ignore: Do not output any warnings or errors, the action does not fail

    if-no-files-found: # optional, default is warn
    # Duration after which artifact will expire in days. 0 means using default retention.
Minimum 1 day. Maximum 90 days unless changed from the repository settings page.

    retention-days: # optional
    # The level of compression for Zlib to be applied to the artifact archive. The value can range from 0 to 9: - 0: No compression - 1: Best speed - 6: Default compression (same as GNU Gzip) - 9: Best compression Higher levels will result in better compression, but will take longer to complete. For large files that are not easily compressed, a value of 0 is recommended for significantly faster uploads.

    compression-level: # optional, default is 6
    # If true, an artifact with a matching name will be deleted before a new one is uploaded. If false, the action will fail if an artifact for the given name already exists. Does not fail if the artifact does not exist.

    overwrite: # optional, default is false
          
# This workflow assumes you have already created the target Azure Static Web App.
# For instructions see https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/get-started-portal?tabs=vanilla-javascript
#
# To configure this workflow:
#
# 1. Set up a secret in your repository named AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN with the value of your Static Web Apps deployment token.
#    For instructions on obtaining the deployment token see: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/deployment-token-management
#
# 3. Change the values for the APP_LOCATION, API_LOCATION and APP_ARTIFACT_LOCATION, AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN environment variables (below).
#    For instructions on setting up the appropriate configuration values go to https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/front-end-frameworks
